# ASD_2021
exercises done for **ASD** course semester 2, year I, Somputer Science, UST

# Description
Since the course was conducted in polish all the folders & files are named in polish, as well as all the comments to the code are in that language. 
As it consisted of both lecutres and practical classes folders are divided in a similar manner.  
Comments were left since they provide usefull knowledge of what a particular algorithm is precisely doing and also for me to be able to reach back into it and understand it easily any given moment.  

# Meanings of folder names and shortkeys
 **wyk** - wykład - lecture - these algorithms were presented during the lectures and are implemented here.  
 **cw** - ćwiczenia - praktical classes - these exercises were done by either me or other students during practicall classes.  
 **BiT_Algo** - zadania z bitu :) - exercises done during additional meetings ran by an **academic circle BiT**. Bless them as they did a lot to save my hopeless brain during the course.  
 **kol & kolosy** - kolokwia - tests - exercises done as test. The ones marked with **kk** inside kolosy_ASD are the special kind, created by my colleague **@lpawlak1** and others during our preparation for the exam and many of the tasks are devised by them.  
 
# Disclaimer
As I upload this repository nearly a year later, some exercises may lack description, some may be missing and so on.
**MOST IMPORTANTLY - some exercises may be implemented incorrectly or ineffectively.**
**I highly recommend using these implementations as clues and source of ideas than perfect solutions.**

If I was able to help you in any way, be kind enough to leave a star and share it with your colleagues.  
  
Some techers may find using GitHub repos disturbing, viewer discretion is advised.
